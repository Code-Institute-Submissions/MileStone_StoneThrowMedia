# Stone Throw Media 
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my gallery site for my photography work to be a subsection onto a greater site to be build down the line.
This site highlights at a quick glace of the style of photograpgy I am cableable off as well as showing off my coding skills, 
and making the overall experinces interative with the images. Also has a way for direct contact with me for any questions someone may have.

## Demo 

A live demo can be found [here](https://synnott3.github.io/MileStone_StoneThrowMedia/#home)

As well as a quck video of the site in action [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VCMQki7iqdOvyh65STf--BwJdrrFUrHy?usp=sharing)

## UX

My goal for the overall design for this site was to make something as easy as possible for people to access as well as to understand how to use the site at a glance, 
I achieved that by keeping to a very minimal design from a framework point of view as well as a simple colour palette which can be found below.

This site uses a lightbox jquery library so the photos can enlarge when pressed, also uses a fixed navbar for ease of navigation through the site.

## Testing

This site was tested across multiple browsers as well multiple screens sizes, and across multiple mobile devices to ensure responsiveness as well as functionality.
These ranging from Chrome on desktop to Safari on iPhone to many android devices.
