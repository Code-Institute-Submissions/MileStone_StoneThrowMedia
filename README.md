# Stone Throw Media 
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my gallery site for my photography work to be a subsection onto a greater site to be build down the line.
This site highlights at a quick glace of the style of photograpgy I am cableable off as well as showing off my coding skills, 
and making the overall experinces interative with the images. Also has a way for direct contact with me for any questions someone may have.

## Demo 

A live demo can be found [here](https://synnott3.github.io/MileStone_StoneThrowMedia/#home)

As well as a quck video of the site in action [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VCMQki7iqdOvyh65STf--BwJdrrFUrHy?usp=sharing)

## UX

My goal for the overall design for this site was to make something as easy as possible for people to access as well as to understand how to use the site at a glance, 
I achieved that by keeping to a very minimal design from a framework point of view as well as a simple colour palette which can be found below.

## Technologies

1. HTMl
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.x)
4. Javascript
5. jquery

## Features

This site uses a lightbox jquery library so the photos can enlarge when pressed, also uses a fixed navbar for ease of navigation through the site.

## Testing

This site was tested across multiple browsers as well multiple screens sizes, and across multiple mobile devices to ensure responsiveness as well as functionality.
These ranging from Chrome on desktop to Safari on iPhone to many android devices.

1. Test navbar using the developer mode  on chrome to make sure it went to the correct sections
2. Test responsiveness of site using developer mode on chrome
3. Once the site was hosted on github test site by sending link to friends to test on their phones in both landscape and portrait mode
4. Test site funtion by screen recording a user on the site which can be found in the demo section.


## Deployment 

I started first by creating a local repository using git init.

over time while working on the project I would commit to Github using Git add for the files I worked on, then using git commit -m to add comments about changes with the site

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository. You can git clone the code to run it locally on your machine.
StoneThrowMedia.com is also owned by me, and soon the site will be going live there using cloudflare.
